## Github public events timeline

This is one of my first react projects I'm creating to get familiar with React library.

#
The project is a single page application that fetches data from [Gihub public events api](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/) and displays in a ond twitter like timeline.

To add some interactivity i made an search filter where you can display latest events from an specific user.

###### In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
